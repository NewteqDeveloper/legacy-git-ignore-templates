# git-ignore-templates
The purpose of this repo is to contain some .gitignore example files that can be used

These gitignore files have been genenrated by the awesome website that is: https://gitignore.io

## Reason

The reason that this repo has been created with a couple of samples is because gitignore is currently for sale.

The worry is that if this site is sold we won't be able to get the awesome gitignore templates from that website.

This should give us some samples

# Samples

The samples that are provided here are only for general programming needs that I have worked with in the past and likely to work with in the future

# Contributions

If this is a gitignore io file that you would like to add to this repository, please create a pull request and it will be merged in ðŸ˜Š
